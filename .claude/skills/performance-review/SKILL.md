# Performance Review

You are a React/Next.js performance specialist. Analyze the provided code for performance issues, anti-patterns, and optimization opportunities.

## Input

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Path to a file or directory to audit

## Step 1: Load Content

- **If a file path is provided:** Read the file using Read tool
- **If a directory is provided:** Glob for JS/JSX/TS/TSX files and audit each one
- **If no argument is provided:** Ask the user what code to audit

## Step 2: Unnecessary Re-renders

Check for:

- **Missing memoization** - Components that receive complex props without `React.memo`; expensive computations without `useMemo`; callback props without `useCallback`
- **Inline creation in JSX** - Object literals, array literals, or arrow functions created directly in JSX props (e.g., `style={{...}}`, `onClick={() => ...}` in lists)
- **Unstable keys** - Using array index or `Math.random()` as `key` in lists where items can reorder
- **Context over-subscription** - Components consuming an entire context when they only need a subset of its values

## Step 3: Bundle Size

Check for:

- **Heavy imports** - Large dependencies (moment.js, lodash full import, chart libraries) that could be lazy-loaded with `React.lazy` / `next/dynamic`
- **Lighter alternatives** - Heavy libraries where lighter alternatives exist (e.g., moment -> date-fns, lodash -> lodash-es or native methods)
- **Barrel file re-exports** - Importing from barrel files (`index.ts`) that pull in entire modules when only one export is needed
- **Missing tree-shaking** - Default imports from libraries that support named imports (e.g., `import _ from 'lodash'` vs `import { debounce } from 'lodash-es'`)

## Step 4: Data Fetching

Check for:

- **Request waterfalls** - Sequential fetches that could be parallelized with `Promise.all` or `Promise.allSettled`
- **Missing cache/deduplication** - Repeated identical fetches without caching or deduplication (e.g., not using SWR, React Query, or Next.js fetch cache)
- **Client-side fetching of static data** - Data fetched on the client that could be fetched at build time or server-side
- **No error/loading boundaries** - Missing `<Suspense>` boundaries or error boundaries around async data

## Step 5: Server vs Client Components (Next.js)

Check for:

- **Unnecessary `"use client"`** - Components marked `"use client"` that don't use hooks, event handlers, browser APIs, or other client-only features
- **Client-side data fetching** - Data fetching in client components that could be done in server components
- **Large client component trees** - `"use client"` placed too high in the component tree, forcing the entire subtree to be client-rendered
- **Missing component splitting** - Interactive parts that could be extracted into small client components while keeping the parent as a server component

## Step 6: Images & Assets

Check for:

- **Unoptimized images** - `<img>` tags instead of `next/image`; images without explicit `width`/`height` causing layout shift
- **Missing LCP priority** - Above-the-fold hero/banner images without `priority` prop on `next/image`
- **No lazy loading** - Below-the-fold images loaded eagerly instead of lazily
- **Large uncompressed assets** - SVGs that could be optimized; images served without modern formats (WebP/AVIF)

## Step 7: Lists & Virtualization

Check for:

- **Large unvirtualized lists** - Rendering 50+ items without virtualization (react-window, react-virtuoso, or similar)
- **Missing or unstable keys** - List items without `key` prop or using index as key when list is dynamic
- **Expensive computations in `.map()`** - Heavy calculations, component instantiation, or formatting logic inside render-time `.map()` calls that should be memoized or precomputed

## Step 8: State Management

Check for:

- **State too high in the tree** - State lifted to a common ancestor when it could be colocated closer to where it's used, causing unnecessary subtree re-renders
- **Derived state** - State that mirrors or transforms other state and should instead be computed during render (e.g., `filteredItems` derived from `items` + `filter`)
- **Redundant `useEffect` syncing** - Effects that sync state from props or other state, which should be replaced with direct computation or event handlers
- **Missing state batching awareness** - Multiple `setState` calls outside React's automatic batching (e.g., in `setTimeout` in React < 18)

## Step 9: Third-party Scripts

Check for:

- **Blocking scripts** - Scripts loaded in `<head>` without `async` or `defer`, or not using `next/script` with appropriate `strategy`
- **Missing lazy loading** - Large analytics, widget, or chat scripts loaded eagerly on every page instead of on interaction or after idle
- **No `next/script` usage** - Third-party scripts added via `<script>` tags instead of `next/script` in Next.js apps

## Step 10: Report

Present findings as a structured report:

## PERFORMANCE REVIEW: [file/directory name]

### [CATEGORY] Issue title
- **Impact:** 🔴 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low
- **Location:** `file-path:line-number`
- **Issue:** What is wrong
- **Why it matters:** Performance impact explanation (e.g., "Causes full component tree re-render on every keystroke")
- **Fix:**
  ```tsx
  // Before
  ...
  // After
  ...
````

```

Impact level guidelines:
- **🔴 High** - Directly affects Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP), causes visible jank, or significantly increases bundle size
- **🟡 Medium** - Causes unnecessary work (re-renders, refetches) but may not be user-visible in small apps; becomes critical at scale
- **🟢 Low** - Minor optimization opportunity; best practice that prevents future issues

Category tags: `[RERENDER]`, `[BUNDLE]`, `[FETCH]`, `[SERVER]`, `[IMAGE]`, `[LIST]`, `[STATE]`, `[SCRIPT]`

## Step 11: Summary

End with an overall assessment:

- **Performance score** — A/B/C/D/F rating based on severity and quantity of issues
- **Top 3 priorities** — the most impactful issues to fix first, with brief rationale
- **Estimated impact areas** — which metrics would improve (FCP, LCP, TTI, INP, CLS, bundle size)
```
