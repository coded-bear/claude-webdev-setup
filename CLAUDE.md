# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains personal Claude Code configuration files for web development workflows. Configuration files are stored in the `.claude/` directory.

## Available MCP Servers

This repository is configured with the following MCP servers:

- **Context7** - Fetches up-to-date documentation for libraries and frameworks. Use it when implementing new features or working with external APIs.
- **Playwright** - Browser automation for testing and web interactions. Use it for scraping, form filling, screenshots, and UI testing.

## Development Guidelines

### Documentation Lookup

Use Context7 to check up-to-date documentation when implementing new libraries or frameworks, or adding features using them. This ensures working with current API patterns rather than potentially outdated knowledge.
